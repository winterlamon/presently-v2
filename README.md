# Presently
Presently allows users to search the Etsy marketplace for products based on category and price range. 

## Features
Users are able to sign up and create a profile detailing their faorite product categories. The user can then either browse the newest items within that category, or search based on price. Finally, favoriting a product will add it to the user's bookmarks, where he or she will be connected directly with the item's Etsy page for purchase.
